# Word Embedding WS 19


Exercises for seminar "word embedding" in winter semester 2019 at Julius Maximilians University WÃ¼rzburg.


The folder "command line scripts" contains a python script for tokenizing the wiki docs created by WikiExtractor (https://github.com/attardi/wikiextractor/blob/master/WikiExtractor.py) and a python script that creates a co-occurrence matrix, 
a document_frequency_matrix (number of documents that contain a certain co-occurrence), tf-idf matrix (co-occurence matrix with tfidf values).

The jupyter notebooks contain necessary steps for tokenizing the wiki docs, creating a co-occurrence matrix, converting the co-occurrence matrix to tfidf matrix and computing the cosine similarity between word vectors in the matrix.
